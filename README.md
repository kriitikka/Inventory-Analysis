# Inventory-Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI project analyzes AdventureWorks manufacturing data, focusing on inventory management, production performance, and waste cost analysis. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor KPIs, identify inefficiencies, and support data-driven decision-making.

Key Features

Inventory Analysis:

Monitors inventory turnover (5), YTD inventory value ($74B), and inventory quantity (336K).

Tracks inventory distribution by part location and identifies high-stock areas.

Production Performance:

Reports YTD production output (4.5M units) and production hours (229K).

Measures average production lead time (297 hrs) and on-time production % (41.6%).

Displays cumulative monthly production trends across fiscal years.

Waste & Cost Analysis:

Tracks waste percentage (0.24%) and cost trends by year.

Identifies high-cost defects (e.g., drill size too small, paint process failures) through a waste cost matrix.

Category & Part-Level Insights:

Pareto analysis of bike components and production totals across product categories.

Highlights top-performing products (e.g., Road Bikes: 349K units produced) and bottlenecks in production.
